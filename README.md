# Set Up MLOps Pipeline
We'll establish an MLOps pipeline to manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning models.

## Tools and AWS Services Required:
- AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.
- AWS CodeCommit for version control (or GitHub).
- Amazon S3 for storing datasets and models.
- DVC (Data Version Control) for data versioning.
- AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.
- AWS Lambda for triggering events (e.g., retraining).
- AWS Step Functions for orchestrating workflows.
- AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment).
- AWS Lambda or CloudWatch for automated retraining.
